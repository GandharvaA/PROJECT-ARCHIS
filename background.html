            <h3> <strong>What is the problem?</strong><h3>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is being plagued by diseases that can evade early detection, thus proving to be a big threat to the human race. Early diagnosis has now assumed a very important role in eradicating such diseases,
                and is quickly becoming the target for better course of treatments.</p>
                <br>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With technological advancements, an increasing number of solutions are finding their way into the ever expanding and intensely complicated arena of
                   healthcare and wellness. We, as a civilization are constantly developing technology to not just prolong lives but to also increase the quality of life.</p>
                <br>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Archis came together with one goal - to create a constructive impact utilising a pragmatic approach. We decided, that to weed out suffering due to diseases,
               we have to target it at its roots. As ground breaking work is already being done to cure innumerable diseases, we turned our attention to diagnosis. We look to build a nanobot capable of early diagnosis - thus recognising, and consequently helping to treat, certain diseases at their infancy.

            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great whites are the largest predatory fish on Earth and are well known as mindless killing machines, taking prey whatever befalls them.</p>
              <br>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fascinated with the way these predators hunt, we dug deep into the details. What gives these amazing creatures an upper hand when it comes to perceiving the presence of their prey, is an extra sense given by specialised receptors called AMPULLAE OF LORENZINI. These receptors
                provide the Great Whites with an ability to sense electromagnetic fields generated by movement of living animals.
                The receptors are extremely sensitive, capable of detecting variations of half a billionth of a volt. Each ampulla consists of a jelly-filled canal
                opening to the surface of the shark by a pore in the skin and ending in a cluster of small pockets full of a special jelly. [1]

            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All living creatures produce an electric field due to muscle contractions, and these muscle contractions are picked up by the sharks.
              Due to high sensitivity of these receptors in sharks, even minute fields produced by weak muscle contractions in the prey, as low as 5nV/cm, can be detected. [3]
               The ampullae measure the potential difference between the voltage at its skin pore and the voltage at the base of the electroreceptor cells. [4]
            </p>

            <h3 id="imageDescription"> Equivalent circuit of AoL [5]</h3>

            <br>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each ampulla is made up of a single layer of cells that contains electrically excitable receptor cells.
               The cells are connected by apical tight junctions so that there is no current leakage between the cells.
               The apical faces of these cells have a small surface area, with a high concentration of voltage dependent calcium channels and
               calcium activated potassium channels. [6] Furthermore, the electric field that they induce inside their bodies, when swimming
               in the magnetic field of the Earth, has been theorized to enable them to sense their magnetic heading. [7]

            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These specialized receptors caught our eye with their uniqueness and laid
               the ground work for our project. Inspired by nature’s greatest creations, we have
               devised a novel method of detection of diseases in the human body system.

        <h3> <strong>How did DIAGNOBOT come into existence?</strong><h3>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human body system is made of trillions of cells working together to run complex processes. Apart from the individual cell components,
             each such cell in the body is comprised of ions present both interior and exterior to it. The main ions present include that of sodium, potassium and
             chlorine along with traces of calcium, magnesium, sulphates and bicarbonate ions. These ions set up
            a potential gradient across the cell membrane due to difference in their concentration on the inside and the outside of the cell. [8]</p>
            <br>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to this difference in potential,
              there is continuous movement of these ions across the cell membrane
               thus leading to the development of a net potential difference. This potential difference is approximately 55mV to
                70mV, directed from the inside of the cell to the outside.
                 [9]</p>
            <br>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a cell is diseased, the movement of these
            ions or the ions concentration in the cytosol is affected, manifesting itself in the form of a change in the net potential difference.
            This change, although in a micro scale, can be effectively measured by DIAGNOBOT, which is a highly sensitive tool.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DIAGNOBOT measures the potential differences of the cells, and compares them to a predetermined set of values for a healthy cell,
              hence recognising the clinical state of the cells.
               Diseases that haven’t yet expressed themselves in the form of symptoms can be
                identified at a molecular level in their infancy.
          </p>
          <br>

          <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Nanobot focuses mainly on diseases that intelligently dodge early diagnosis,
               hence paving the way for better healthcare options.
          </p>

          <br>

          <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all leave dents in this universe, some marks much bigger than the others.
              What matters not is the size of this mark, but whether it was made for the better or for worse.
               We choose the earlier. Not all marks humans leave are scars.
